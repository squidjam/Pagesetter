KNOWN PROBLEMS
--------------

*** Failing to lock database tables when saving a publication ***

  Pagesetter requires database access to lock the tables it depends on. This is 
  used to guarantee the integrity of the data, especially various counters used
  by Pageseter.

  If you have admin access to MySQL you can grante "LOCK TABLES" access to your
  users. Look up "Lock_Tables_Priv" or "LOCK TABLES" in your MySQL manual.

  If you cannot get lock access then search for "pagesetterLockTables" in 
  "common-edit.php" and comment out the lines mentioned in the source code. This
  will disable locking at the cost of a slightly less stable system (in the
  face of simultaneous editors).


*** Failing to initialize, upgrade or remove the module ***

  Pagesetter cannot initialize, upgrade or be removed in PostNuke versions
  prior til .75. This is due to a problem with a core API function that
  disallows modules to use their own API's during the process. The problem
  has been fixed in PostNuke .75. If you are not using this or a proper
  release candidate (I cannot remember which) then you can hack the function
  yourself:

    1) Edit "html/includes/pnMod.php"

    2.1) Find:
    
           function pnModAPILoad($modname, $type = 'user')

    2.2) Change it to:
    
           function pnModAPILoad($modname, $type = 'user', $force = false)

    3.1) A few lines below you find:

           // check the modules state
           if (!pnModAvailable($modname)) {
             return false;
           }

    3.2) Change it to:

           // check the modules state
           if (!$force && !pnModAvailable($modname)) {
             return false;
           }


*** Failing to load list templates (after upgrading 4 -> 5) ***

  Pagesetter can display a list of publications through either a combination
  of header/footer/item templates or through a single template. The choice is
  based on the existence of the header template - if it exists then the 
  combination is used, otherwise the single template is used.

  A side effect of this is that your lists won't work if you are displaying
  lists without a header template. Solve this problem by adding an empty
  header template.


INSTALLING PAGESETTER
---------------------

1) Install pnRender (see http://mods.postnuke.com/modules.php?op=modload&name=News&file=article&sid=2053).
   This is a *must* for pre-.750 PostNuke systems, since Pagesetter depends on pnRender instead of 
   Smarty's own distribution. Make sure everything works (however that is done ;-).
   if you are using a multi-site installation then you might want to check:
   http://www.elfisk.dk/modules.php?op=modload&name=XForum&file=viewthread&tid=462 and
   http://noc.postnuke.com/forum/forum.php?thread_id=854&forum_id=2

2) Copy the "pagesetter" directory and all it's sub-directories into
   the PostNuke "modules" directory.

3) In order to enable searching the file "pnsearch/pagesetter.php" should be 
   moved to "/includes/search".

4) Go to PostNuke's admin page and find the "modules" setup. Here you
   regenerate the module list and then initialize and activate Pagesetter.

5) Read the manual in docs/manual/... - please! There's a lot of information about
   permissions and Pagesetter setup.

6) Add all the styles in file docs/pagesetter.css to your PostNuke theme 
   style sheet (themes/your-theme/styles/style.css):

   This will ensure the "edit this" popup looks as expected as well as a couple of
   other things. Feel free to modify the styles as much as you want.

7) For improved performance, make sure pnRender caching is enabled.
   Go to "Admin - pnRender" and enable caching.


UPGRADING 6.2.0 - 6.3.0
-----------------------

You need to upgrade your own templates to include hooks functionality.
See http://www.pndevs.com/index.php?module=blogs&func=viewpub&tid=1&pid=5
and read the manual (hooks section).

Due to the changed hook handling you should also clear the pnRender cache folders
pnTemp/pnRender_cache and pnTemp/pnRender_compiled.


UPGRADING 6.1.0 - 6.2.0
-----------------------

Nothing special.


UPGRADING 6.0.x - 6.1.0
-----------------------

1) You must change your CSS definition for the "EditThis" popups. Change:

    #pubInfoBox
    {
     ...
    }

   To:

    table.pubInfoBox
    {
     ...
    }

2) Change $editThis$ in your templates to:

       <!--[nocache]--><!--[$core.editThis]--><!--[/nocache]--> 
   OR  <!--[nocache]--><!--[$core.editInfo]--><!--[/nocache]-->


3) Change $hitCount$ in your templates to:

   <!--[nocache]--><!--[$core.hitCount]--><!--[/nocache]-->


UPGRADING 5.2 - 6.0.0
---------------------

Nothing special, just copy into your PostNuke directories and upgrade/activate.


UPGRADING 5.X -> 5.2.0
----------------------

Nothing special, just copy into your PostNuke directories and upgrade/activate.


UPGRADING 4.0.0.0 -> 5.0.0.0
----------------------------

*) Add the following to your PostNuke theme style sheet 
  (themes/your-theme/styles/style.css):

    #pubInfoBox
    {
      border: 1px solid black;
      font: arial, sans-serif;
      font-size: 10pt;
      background-color: #E0E0E0;
      padding: 4px;
    }

   This will ensure the "edit this" popup looks as expected. Feel free to modify the
   styles as much as you want.



UPGRADING 3.0.0.0 -> 4.0.0.0
----------------------------

Nothing special, just copy into your PostNuke directories and upgrade/activate.

In order to enable searching the file "pnsearch/pagesetter.php" should be 
moved to "html/includes/search".


UPGRADING 2.0.0.0 -> 3.0.0.0
----------------------------

Nothing special, just copy into your PostNuke directories and upgrade/activate.


UPGRADING 1.0.0.0 -> 2.0.0.0
----------------------------

1) Backup everything - both database and files.

2) If you skipped step 1 then at least backup your template files!

3) Install pnRender (see http://mods.postnuke.com/modules.php?op=modload&name=News&file=article&sid=2053).
   This is a *must* since Pagesetter now depends on pnRender instead of 
   Smarty's own distribution. Make sure everything works.

3) Remove whole pagesetter directory structure. A couple of things have 
   changed or moved and this is probably the easist way to fix everything.
   Did you backup your templates?

1) Copy the "pagesetter" directory and all it's sub-directories into
   the PostNuke "modules" directory.

2) Go to PostNuke's admin page and find the "modules" setup. Here you
   regenerate the module list and then upgrade and activate Pagesetter.


) Rename your existing template files from "*.tpl" to "*.html". Then copy them
  into the pntemplates directory.


CVS Upgrade 1.x -> 2.0.0.0
--------------------------
If upgrade fails then remove the list tables from your database
(_pagesetter_list*), reset Pagesetter version number in modules database to 
1.1.0.0 and retry upgrade.

If you have created lists and are using them, then you may need to delete all
list fields in your publication type setup and then re-insert them to force an 
update of the database schema. After that you need to re-edit all publications
that uses list fields.


Translating Pagesetter
----------------------
  * Copy and edit the normal PostNuke language files.
  * Copy and edit the language files in "pagesetter/guppy/lang/..."
