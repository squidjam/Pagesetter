Pagesetter (C) 2003 Jorn Wildt
==============================

Version NEXT
-------------
  * Adding PostNuke .8 compliant search API.
  * Bugfix: topic access check failed for PostNuke .8
  * Bugfix: other topic problems for .8 (hopefully works with .7)


Version 6.3.0
-------------
  * Adding new "Relation" input field type. Can be used to build
    Many-to-Many relations. Huge thanks to Carsten Kollmeier for his work.
  * Added new "Publication" input field type. Can be used to build
    parent/child relations between publications.
  * Restyling the interface.
  * Making publication type creation more "Wizard" like. It now also
    creates example templates for you, so you are up and running with
    your first publication in a few clicks.
  * Added pub type selector and paging to PN searching plugin.
    Big thanks to jmvdrine for the code!!!
  * Improved search expression analyzer. You can now use double quotes to enclose
    words that must be next to each other.
  * Adding counting in paged publication lists (until now you had to fetch everthing
    and then count the size of that list). Improves performance.
    API:  $pubCount = pnModAPIFunc('pagesetter', 'user', 'getPubList', 
                                    array(..., 'countOnly'  => true, ...));
  * Adding top-menu to a few extra pages (thanks to Drak).
  * Updating German language files - not complete though.
  * Category selector now displays "+ + C" instead of "A:B:C" (for category
    C nested in B and A). This makes the selector a lot shorter.
  * Language selector is now restricted to installed languages.
  * Adding maxlength=X to all text-based inputs.
  * Adding some helptext to the pub type list. Visible only with no types.
  * Guppy XML layout now includes <text>...</text> to include any text or
    HTML (which must be enclosed in CDATA elements).
  * Guppy XML layout supports internationalization using $_LANGDEFINE$
    inside <text> elements.
  * Added "backurl" as a URL parameter. Used to specify redirection after edit.

    and "id" references. It is defined as a parameter in the XML file.

  * Added organization of publications in a folder structure, using
    a separate module "Folder".
  * Added support for creation of two similar publication types for use
    with the Folder module: Generic file uploads and Image uploads

  * The publication list now remembers current page number when editing something

    These are the properties you can use: id, value, title, and fulltitle

      <!--[nocache]--><!--[$core.editThis]--><!--[/nocache]-->
      <!--[nocache]--><!--[$core.editInfo]--><!--[/nocache]--> NEW!
      <!--[nocache]--><!--[$core.hitCount]--><!--[/nocache]-->

    As a result you must change your stylesheet - check the upgrade instructions.
    - Thanks goes to Claus Parkhoi for the required code.

    must have been configured for use before sending mails from Pagesetter.

    This specifies the directory where special input forms are stored.

Version 6.0.1
-------------
  * Bugfix: image uploads were lost when updating a publication.


Version 6.0.0
-------------
  * Added file upload as a field type.
  * Added a plugin system for Guppy inputs.
    Used this for e-mails, urls and date-time inputs.
  * Changed HTML output in pagesetter_listBrowser, so sub-lists are now included in
    the list items (<li>Name<ul>...</ul></li>) which I believe is more correct.
  * Now "publish date" is auto completed with the current date if left empty.
    - configurable in the general setup.
  * Now both publish and expire dates include hours and minutes.
  * Pasting of Pagesetter publication links into the editor will not overwrite
    selected text with title of selected publication.
  * Added some simplified $core info to header/footer of list block.
  * Added new version (0.9.6) of the DHTML calendar. Fixed SF #916447.
  * Integration API now returns $tid on schema import.

  * Added an admin.gif icon (thanks to Tom Sheehan).
  * Improving pubPager and pubPagerPlus plugins with categories (and other url stuff).
    Thanks to Claus Parkhoi for fixes.
  * Authors (without access to pub. list) are now redirected to http-referer or 
    just the frontpage after submission.
  * Bugfix: "editorsetup.js" did not respect template file names, but used pub. title.
  * Bugfix: checking for default publication type failed.
  * Bugfix: improved sending of mail
  * Bugfix: customized layouts were not loaded via publication type template (used title)
  * Bugfix: setting default values in URL did not work (using "&set_xyz=abc").
  * Bugfix: added missing language defines for "pub" block.
  * Bugfix: the little "edit this" popup cannot display publication data when the
            displayed data is cached (since the data is missing then). So that
            information has been left out. A future version should implement some
            kind of "on demand" loading of the data (using overlib?).
  * Bugfix: the $core variable was not set globally for use in plugins used with
            the "single list" template.
  * Bugfix: some error messages had stopped working in Guppy.
  * Bugfix: SourceForge [1103300].

    delete pub. with ID 0 instead of the requested.

    (mostly the "online" flag in the publication list).

  * Bugfix: user defined bool fields now defaults to zero, and does not get null values.


Version 5.1.0
-------------
  * Added new session handling and increased session size from "blob" to "mediumblob".
    - Sessions (or "state") for the input forms are now stored in a Pagesetter specific
      database table. This should increase performance *and* fix the "unknown window
      data" bug.
  * Added new "template" filename field in pubtype setup. Makes it possible to use templates 
    with different names than the pubtype title.
  * Added new pnRender plugins
    - pagesetter_title: allows you to place content in the <title> tag (Xantia only).
    - pagesetter_header: allows you to add anything to the <head> area (any theme).

  * Added orderby parameter to "list" block.
  * Added category comparison parameter to "listmenu" block.
  * Added support for custom input forms layout depending on workflow state.
  * Added a new template type called "list-single" which is a single template that takes the place of the other three 
    (list, list-header, and list-footer). There is a performance hit due to it not being cached. It is invoked by 
    adding &tpltype=single to the URL.
