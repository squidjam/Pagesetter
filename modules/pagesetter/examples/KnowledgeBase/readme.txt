Knowledge base Example
======================

This is an example of how Pagesetter can be used for a structure knowledge base.

Installation:

1) Import the XML schema file (admin : pagesetter : tools : import).
   This will create the publication type named "KnowledgeBase" and setup a few
   category items related to a knowledge base (for Pagesetter/Photoshare). You
   can edit this list afterwards to suit your own needs.

2) Copy all KnowledgeBase-*.html template files into your theme directory in
   "themes/YourTheme/templates/modules/pagesetter".

3) Insert the CSS styles in "styles.css" in your theme's style sheet.

4) Now point your browser to ".../index.php?module=pagesetter&tid=T" where T
   is the ID for the imported publication type.
