  <title>Internals</title>

  <para>Parsing of the XML files for forms specification and layout is handled
  in guppy_parser.php. The code here creates a large associative array that
  describes the form. The data is stored in a PHP session variable. New
  attributes for the XML structure must be parsed here.</para>

  <para>Rendering of the HTML and handling of user input is done in guppy.php.
  New attributes returned from the XML parser must be handled here.</para>

  <para>99% of the stuff that is PostNuke related is implemented in
  guppy_postnuke.php in the hope that this makes it possible to reuse Guppy in
  another framework.</para>
