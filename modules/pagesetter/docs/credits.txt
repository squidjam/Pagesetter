Pagesetter (C) 2003 Jorn Wildt
==============================

Thanks to Carsten Kollmeier, Tony Jensen, Sebastian Schurmann, Jorg Napp, 
Thomas Smiatek, jmvedrine, Drak, and Claus Parkhoi for various code snippets 
as well as complete functions and blocks - and tons of inspiration. Without
these people Pagesetter wouldn't be what it is today.

Many thanks to the guys at www.interactivetools.com who made the HTML editor "htmlArea" - it's a very cool product.
Further more also thanks to those behind Xinha - the next version htmlArea.

Also lots of thanks to the guys at smarty.php.net who made the Smarty templating engine. The same does of course
also apply to those that extended Smarty to pnRender, which then again includes, more or less, all the people
behind PostNuke.

Thanks goes also to Mihai Bazon (at //dynarch.com/mishoo/home.epl) who made the realy nice date picker.
