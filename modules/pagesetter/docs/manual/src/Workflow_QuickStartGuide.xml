  <title>Quick Start Guide</title>

  <para>This will answer the question "How do I get my existing Publication
  Types working with Workflow?". The reason for this is that every publication
  type now needs a workflow attached to it. If it does not, you will receive
  an error.</para>

    <title>The Steps</title>

    <procedure>
      <step>
        <para>Edit your publication type and assign a workflow to it. If you
        are not sure which one to use, use the Standard workflow. It mimics
        the Postnuke News module which most people should be familiar with.
        Check also the workflow list in the previous section of this
        manual.</para>
      </step>

      <step>
        <para>Go to Configuration::Workflow and edit your publication type.
        This allows you to set up the needed workflow information specific to
        your publication type.</para>
      </step>

      <step>
        <para>Start using it. Play around with it. Create a new publication.
        Work with a few that already exist. It should start making sense
        quickly.</para>
      </step>
